SortableJS allows your users to reorder items in an unordered list, 
giving users a visual dimension to specific actions and modifications.
                        
* Our task was to build a web page to organize all the data given.

   Instruction

   All that data  are in all.json.

   Use fetch. 

   Display Only  necessary data 

   Use   search() method

   Use    Sort function

- In order to get the information we needed for this project, we used fetch.  
     
      fetch. in  JS, it always returns a Promise.
      
      Fetching the data


- Display Only  necessary data. So we  only show some of the fields in a <table> element.


- Search makes possible to filter information by searching the name as a string. 

          The search should it is  interactive

          And  the results it is  filtered after every keystroke.

 
- Sort it is  valuable to sort the information in the table by any of its columns.
